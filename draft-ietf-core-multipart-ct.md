# Introduction

This memo defines application/multipart-core, an application-independent
media type that can be used to combine representations of zero or more
different media types, each along with a CoAP Content-Format
identifier {{-coap}}, into a single representation, with minimal framing overhead.
This combined representation may then be carried in a single message,
for instance as the body or payload of a transfer protocol request or response.

This simple and efficient binary framing mechanism can be employed to
create application specific message bodies which build on
multiple already existing media types.

As the name of the media type suggests, it is inspired by the
multipart media types that started to be defined with the original set
of MIME specifications {{-mime-types}}.  However, while those needed
to focus on the syntactic aspects of integrating multiple
representations into one e-mail, transfer protocols providing full data
transparency such as CoAP as well as readily available encoding
formats such as the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
{{-cbor}} shift the focus towards the intended
use of the combined representations.  In this respect, the basic
intent of the application/multipart-core media type is like that of
multipart/mixed (Section 5.1.3 of {{-mime-types}}).  The detailed
semantics of the representations are refined by the context
established by the application in the accompanying request parameters,
e.g., the resource URI and any further options (header fields), but
three usage scenarios are envisioned:

The individual representations in an application/multipart-core message body
occur in a sequence, which may be employed by an application where
such a sequence is natural, e.g. for a number of audio snippets in
various formats to be played out in that sequence, or search results
returned in order of relevance.

In other cases, an application may be more interested in a bag of
representations, which are distinguished by their Content-Format identifier,
such as an audio snippet and a text representation accompanying it.
In such a case, the sequence in which these occur may not be relevant
to the application.
This specification adds the option of
substituting a null value for the representation of an optional part,
which indicates that the part is not present.

A third situation that is common only ever has a single representation
in the sequence, where the sender already selects just one of a set of formats
possible for this situation.  This kind of union "type" of formats may
also make the presence of the actual representation optional, the
omission of which leads to a zero-length array.

Where these rules are not sufficient for an application, it might
still use the general format defined here, but register a new media
type and an associated Content-Format identifier to associate the
representation with these more specific semantics instead of using
the application/multipart-core media type.

Also, future specifications might want to define rough equivalents for
other multipart media types with specific semantics not covered by the
present specification, such as multipart/alternative (Section 5.1.4 of
{{-mime-types}}), where several alternative representations are
provided in the message body, but only one of those is to be selected by
the recipient for its use (this is less likely to be useful in a
constrained environment that has facilities for pre-flight discovery).

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Multipart Content-Format Encoding {#encoding}

A representation of media type application/multipart-core contains a collection of
zero or more representations, each along with their respective content
format.

The collection is encoded as a CBOR {{-cbor}} array with an even
number of elements.
Counting from zero, the odd-numbered elements are a byte string containing
a representation, or the value `null` if an optional part is indicated
as not given.
The (even-numbered) element preceding each of these is an unsigned integer
specifying the content format ID of the representation following it.

For example, a collection containing two representations, one with
content format ID 42 and one with content format ID 0, looks like this
in CBOR diagnostic notation:

> \[42, h'0123456789abcdef', 0, h'3031323334']

For illustration, the structure of an application/multipart-core representation can
be described by the CDDL {{-cddl}} specification in {{mct-cddl}}:

~~~CDDL
multipart-core = [* multipart-part]
multipart-part = (type: uint .size 2, part: bytes / null)
~~~
{:#mct-cddl title="CDDL for application/multipart-core"}

This format is intended as a strict specification: An implementation
MUST stop processing the representation if there is a CBOR
well-formedness error, a deviation from the structure defined above,
or any residual data left after processing the CBOR data item.
(This generally means the representation is not processed at
all except if some streaming processing has already happened.)

# Usage Example: CoAP Observing Resources

This section illustrates one less obvious example for using
application/multipart-core: combining it with observing a resource
{{-observe}} to handle pending results.

When a CoAP client registers to observe a resource for which no
representation is available yet, the server may send one or more 2.05
(Content) notifications before sending the first actual 2.05
(Content) or 2.03 (Valid) notification.  A diagram depicting possible
resulting sequences of notifications, identified by their respective
response code, is shown in {{fig-sequence}}.

          __________       __________       __________
         |          |     |          |     |          |
    ---->|   2.05   |---->|  2.05 /  |---->|  4.xx /  |
         |  Pending |     |   2.03   |     |   5.xx   |
         |__________|     |__________|     |__________|
            ^   \ \          ^    \           ^
             \__/  \          \___/          /
                    \_______________________/
{: #fig-sequence title="Sequence of Notifications"}

The specification of the Observe option requires that all
notifications carry the same Content-Format.  The
application/multipart-core media type can be used to provide that
Content-Format: e.g., carrying an empty list of representations in the
case marked as "Pending" in {{fig-sequence}}, and carrying a single
representation specified as the target content-format in the case in
the middle of the figure.

# Implementation Hints

This section describes the serialization for readers that may be new
to CBOR.  It does not contain any new information.

An application/multipart-core representation carrying no
representations is represented by an empty CBOR array, which is
serialized as a single byte with the value 0x80.

An application/multipart-core representation carrying a single
representation is represented by a two-element CBOR array, which is
serialized as 0x82 followed by the two elements.  The first element is
an unsigned integer for the Content-Format value, which is represented as described in
{{tbl-integer}}.  The second element is the object as a byte string,
which is represented as a length as described in {{tbl-length}}
followed by the bytes of the object.

| Serialization  |      Value |
| 0x00..0x17     |      0..23 |
| 0x18 0xnn      |    24..255 |
| 0x19 0xnn 0xnn | 256..65535 |
{: #tbl-integer title="Serialization of content-format"}

| Serialization  |     Length |
| 0x40..0x57     |      0..23 |
| 0x58 0xnn      |    24..255 |
| 0x59 0xnn 0xnn | 256..65535 |
| 0x5a 0xnn 0xnn 0xnn 0xnn | 65536..4294967295  |
| 0x5b 0xnn .. 0xnn (8 bytes)  | 4294967296.. |
{: #tbl-length title="Serialization of object length"}

For example, a single text/plain object (content-format 0) of value
"Hello World" (11 characters) would be serialized as

> 0x82 0x00 0x4b H e l l o 0x20 W o r l d

In effect, the serialization for a single object is done by prefixing
the object with information that there is one object (here: 0x82),
about its content-format (here: 0x00) and its length (here: 0x4b).

For more than one representation included in an
application/multipart-core representation, the head of the CBOR array
is adjusted (0x84 for two representations, 0x86 for three, ...) and
the sequences of content-format and embedded representations follow.

For instance, the example from {{encoding}} would be serialized as:

> 0x84 (*) 0x182A 0x48 0x0123456789ABCDEF (+) 0x00 0x45 0x3031323334

where (*) marks the start of the information about the first
representation (content-format 42, byte string length 8) and, (+), of
the second representation (content-format 0, byte string length 5).
